# Computer-Vision

This study evaluates the performance of ResNet, DenseNet, and a custom CNN in classifying chest X-ray images into COVID-19, pneumonia, and normal categories. Using the COVID-19 Radiography Database with 4,575 images, the models were trained with preprocessing techniques like resizing and padding, and data augmentation. The models are build from scratch by using Keras and TensorFlow.
